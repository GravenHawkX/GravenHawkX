                        <td>The plains are a very common biome, they spawn a lot of passive mobs such as pigs, cows, sheep, and horses.A place full of villages and oak, birch tree spawns to enjoy</td>
                        <td>Forests are a very nice to start out in due to the number of trees nearby for harvesting wood.  There are other variations of forest. The flower forest will grow nearly every kind of flower in the game.</td>
                        <td>There are three types of jungle biomes that are in the game. The first is a normal jungle biome and the second being a jungle edge biome. Jungle edge biomes are essentially mixed biomes to transition the jungle biomes into others.</td>
                        <td>The Nether biome is separate from the overworld. The Nether has recently updated to include multiple biomes including Soul Sand Valleys and Crimson forrests. There are Nether Fortresses containing exclusive resources</td>
                        <td>Mountain biomes are often recognizable due to the large amount of stone, floating islands, alcoves, and spires that are present. Mountain biomes are also the only biomes that emeralds generate in, which are useful for villager trading</td>
                        <td>Desert biomes are very bare. They contain sand, sandstone, dead bushes, brown rabbits, and cacti. Desert villages, pillager outposts, temples, and wells with some lakes are sometimes found in the biome as well</td>
                        <td>aiga biomes are a combination of the jungle and forest biomes. They typically have spruce trees and ferns. Taigas can contain wolves, foxes, sweet berry bushes, villages, pillager outposts, and more. One variation of the taiga biome would be ‘giant tree taiga’.</td>
                        <td>A snowy tundra biome is a vast amount of land covered in snow with a scarce amount of wildlife spread. Polar bears and rabbits can be found here. </td>
                        <td>The ice spikes biome is a rare biome where large structures and clumps of ice are scattered around almost like trees. The resources within are even more difficult to find than the snow tundra biome, however the biome does have access to large amounts of ice.</td>
                        <td>Swamp biomes are usually one of the most dangerous biomes to survive in. Witch huts generate in these biomes and slime spawns occur naturally at night. </td>
                        <td>There are two variations of the savannah biome with the first being a normal savannah biome. Acacia trees can be found in this biome, along with herds of horses and llamas. Villages and pillager outposts can generate in these biomes as well.</td>
